# lightPercent

A very, very basic utility that shows the percentage of the brightness of the backlight.

That is, if you use a Dell XPS 13 (9360).

And run Arch Linux (or something using the same filepaths as Arch Linux).

So, probably not very useful for anyone but me.

Oh yeah, and now it only shows the integer that represents the current brightness, not
the percentage that integer is of the maximum brightness. It'll get there.
